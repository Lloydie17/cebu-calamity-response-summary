# Cebu Calamity Response Summary

This repository, **cebu-calamity-response-summary**, provides a summarized view of data gathered from the original **cebu-calamity-response** API. The original application, developed by Clint Alonzo, Ralph Adriane Dilao, and Vince Clave Igot, was created to aid in responding to the aftermath of the earthquake in Northern Cebu. 

The **cebu-calamity-response-summary** project aggregates and simplifies the data provided by the original API, offering a concise summary of the following key information for each municipality:

- **Total affected individuals**  
- **Critical needs of the affected areas**  
- **Location details of the barangays (brgy)**  

This summary feature was added to streamline access to critical data, which was not available in the original application. By providing an overview of the key statistics, it aims to assist responders, local authorities, and citizens with better decision-making during the state of calamity.

**Note**: This repository serves as a temporary tool to support the affected areas during the current calamity, enhancing data accessibility and improving response coordination.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
